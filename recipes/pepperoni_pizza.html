    <p><em>Home made delicious pepperoni pizza</em></p>
    
    <p>Pepperoni Pizza is the king of pizzas. Made with only four main ingredients, it is a sufficient and mind-blowing option for the average friday dinner.
        It is a combination of grease, salt, <strong>absolute taste</strong> and spicy pepperoni, even thinking about it should make one's mouth water.
    </p>
    <h4>There are <b>five valid ways/reasons</b> to torture oneself with pepperoni pizza: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Going to a restaurant, avoid paying for the ridiculously expensive wine by ordering a pizza</li>
    <li>Long day at the office, don't have the energy to cook -> order a pizza</li>
    <li>Frozen pizza... it's cheap! </li>
    <li>Feeling frisky, make yourself a pizza</li>
    <li>Being drunk, it's AMAZING</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Preperation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Assuming the obvious: you are not preparing it by yourself; Move to step 2.</li>
    <li>Taking as an axiom: you can't afford a restaurant; Move to step3</li>
    <li>Ask yourself, how much have you been drinking?</li>
    <li>In the most likely case, Order a pizza, it's waaaay better and at this state you don't care about money</li>
    <li>If caught sober, walk to the shop or just open the freezer and prepare it in the oven</li>
    <li>If you are disappointed by the recipe, want to make a pizza and are just about to click away, I strongly suggest returning to step1 </li>
</ol>
